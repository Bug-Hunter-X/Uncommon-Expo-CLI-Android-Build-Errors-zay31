This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android SDK build tools or the Gradle build system.  It can manifest in various ways, including errors related to missing dependencies, incorrect build configurations, or conflicts between different versions of tools or libraries.  A common symptom is an error message during the `expo build:android` process, pointing to problems within the `android` folder of your Expo project, which is often automatically generated and managed by Expo. The exact error message varies and depends on the root cause.  One possible cause is that an `android/gradlew` file is missing or corrupted.
