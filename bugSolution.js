The solution often involves carefully inspecting the Expo project's `android` folder and addressing the specific error messages.  It might require:

1. **Cleaning the build:** `expo prebuild --clean` or manually deleting the `android` folder and then running `expo prebuild`. This can resolve temporary build conflicts. 
2. **Checking Gradle version compatibility:** Ensure the project's Gradle version aligns with the Expo CLI version and the Android SDK. Update Gradle as necessary.
3. **Resolving dependency issues:** Use `npm ls` to verify the dependencies and look for conflicts.  Try `expo install <package_name>` to reinstall potentially problematic packages. 
4. **Verifying the `android/gradlew` file:** If missing, recreate it using Expo's tools. A corrupted file might require a more thorough clean build.
5. **Examining logs for detailed errors:** The full build logs often provide insights into the root cause, allowing for targeted solutions. 
6. **Trying Expo Go:** In some cases, directly testing on Expo Go might rule out local issues.
